# Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health data.  
It demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle
- Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Age, etc.
- Target: Outcome (1 = Diabetes, 0 = No Diabetes)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualization)

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature scaling and selection
3. Model training (SVm,etc.)
4. Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
5. Deployment ( Streamlit app)
